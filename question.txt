I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I am a machine learning major.  
This course is helpful to have a deeper understanding of machine learning as it pertains to my career.
Multiple different topics are in the class syllabus, and it's good to have basic knowledge on a lot of things in computer science as it helps further your understanding.
